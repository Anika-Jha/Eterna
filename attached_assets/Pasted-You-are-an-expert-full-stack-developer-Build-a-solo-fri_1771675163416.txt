You are an expert full-stack developer. Build a **solo-friendly Next.js + React project called "Eterna"**, a living digital museum where human skills, traditions, recipes, and rituals are preserved as NFTs that **fade over time unless supported** by the community. Include the following features in the scaffold, covering all loopholes and making it judge-proof:

1. **Artifact Submission**
   - Users can upload:
     - Image (use uploaded image as-is; DO NOT generate AI art)
     - Artifact type (recipe, skill, ritual, profession, etc.)
     - Artifact description
     - Optional tags/categories
   - Instructions visible on the page: 
     > "Submit your artifact to preserve it. Your memory lives here — or fades if neglected."
   - Generate **symbolic AI reasoning** for extinction risk (even simple GPT-3.5 or Hugging Face call):
     - Example output: "This skill has a 72% chance to fade in the next 15 years."
     - Optional: short poetic narrative about the artifact.

2. **NFT Gallery**
   - Display all submissions as cards with:
     - Uploaded image
     - Artifact type
     - Description
     - Extinction Risk Score
     - Fade level (0–100)
   - Fade mechanics:
     - Gradual desaturation / blur / transparency over time
     - Fade visually resets partially when supported
   - Hover effect: show metadata and comments
   - Prominent **vibe lines** on cards or gallery:
     > "Preserve it or watch it ghost."  
     > "Memories don’t last… unless you stake."  
     > "Extinct? Not on my watch."  
     > "Keep it alive, or watch it dissolve."

3. **Support Mechanics**
   - Each NFT card has three buttons: **Vote**, **Stake**, **Interact**
   - Clicking a button:
     - Resets or reduces fade level
     - Updates frontend state
     - Shows glow/highlight animation
     - Tooltip explains functionality:
       > "Vote to show you care."  
       > "Stake to preserve this memory."  
       > "Interact to keep it alive."
   - Cumulative support count visible on NFT card

4. **Comments & Idea Sharing**
   - Users can add comments under each NFT
   - Display comments with timestamps and support count (upvotes)
   - Encourage community discussion

5. **Dashboard**
   - Right panel or separate page showing:
     - Extinction probability trends across all NFTs
     - Total vote/stake/interact counts
     - Most commented NFTs
   - Updates **in real-time** as users interact
   - Graphical visualizations for trends (bar chart, line graph)
   - Dashboard includes clear instructions:
     > "Artifacts fade over time. Support to preserve them. Add comments to enrich the archive."

6. **Styling & Animations**
   - Museum-like aesthetics:
     - Soft serif fonts for gallery
     - Warm earthy colors for artifact display
     - Sharp, minimal graphs for dashboard
   - Smooth fade animation for NFTs
   - Animated glow/highlight on support button click
   - Hover transitions for metadata display

7. **Technical Stack**
   - React functional components with hooks
   - Frontend state stores all NFT data, fade levels, interactions, and comments
   - Use Next.js API routes if needed to store comments or support actions (optional: local JSON or browser storage)
   - Fade simulation time-based (fade increases over time, resets on support)
   - AI-generated extinction narratives use free API (GPT-3.5 or Hugging Face) or placeholder function
   - NFT minting can be simulated in frontend state or optionally deployed to testnet (Polygon Mumbai / Goerli)
   - Fully solo-buildable; no heavy backend required

8. **Instructions & Demo Notes**
   - On upload page: instructions for uploading artifacts and describing their significance
   - Tooltips for each support button explaining the effect
   - Dashboard shows how interactions affect extinction trends
   - Comments section encourages sharing ideas and interacting with other artifacts
   - All vibe lines integrated prominently for judge impact

9. **Output Requirements**
   - Generate **full Next.js + React scaffold** including:
     - Artifact submission form
     - NFT gallery with fade + vote/stake/interact
     - Comments and idea-sharing system
     - Interactive dashboard
     - Inline instructions, tooltips, and vibe lines
     - Styling and animations
     - AI extinction narrative integration
   - Prioritize **demoability, interactivity, creativity, and Web3 vibe**  
   - Include **inline comments** explaining AI logic, fade mechanics, support logic, and dashboard updates

Generate a **working, ready-to-run scaffold** implementing all of the above for a 36-hour solo hackathon. Make it **playable, visually impressive, and conceptually memorable**.
